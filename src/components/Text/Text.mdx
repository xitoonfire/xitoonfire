# Text Component Documentation

## Overview

The `Text` component is a versatile React component for rendering various types of text elements in a consistent and customizable way. It supports multiple HTML tags, including headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, inline text (`span`), and more, with additional styling options like bold, italics, and highlights. It is built using TypeScript and supports Tailwind CSS for easy styling.

## Installation

Ensure you have React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS set up in your project.

```bash
npm install react
npm install typescript
npm install tailwindcss
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

```tsx
import React from "react";
import Text from "./Text";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Text variant="h1">This is an H1 heading</Text>
      <Text variant="p">This is a paragraph of text.</Text>
      <Text variant="blockquote">This is a blockquote.</Text>
    </div>
  );
